My Chord Book Website is composed of 8 static HTML pages:
1.) index.html - contains unordered list containing links to the main pages (home, favorite, song index, about)
2.) home.html - home page. It used Bootstrap NavBar component, Image, Unordered lists, Tables, links
3.) favorites.html - This page contains all the favorites songs. It uses NavBar and Tables and links
4.) songindex.html - This page contains the alphabetical listing of songs. It uses NavBar, unordered lists and links.
5.) about.html - this page contains history of the Website. It uses NavBar.
6.) heyjude.html - this page shows the Lyrics with Chords for the song Hey Jude by the beatles.
7.) perfect.html - this page shows the Lyrics with Chords for the song Perfect by Ed Sheeran.
8.) letitbeme.html - this page shows the Lyrics with Chords for the song Let it be Me by the beatles.

Additionally, for the mysite.scss:
* It uses the ID and class selectors
* It uses at least 5 properites (color, background-color, width, border, padding, font-size)
* It uses SCSS global variable (e.g., GlobalPadding)
* It uses SCSS Nesting as shown in the SongTable Table
* It uses SCSS Inheritance as shown by %SongTableProp
* Uses Media Query to reduce the width of the Image #banner when width is smaller than 600px.

I have a hard time using the Bootstrap Grid Flex layouts as I don't know where I should put it my site that aligns to the overall theme. :)
Alas! I tried to use it in the favorites.html (to be removed in the future version - haha).
